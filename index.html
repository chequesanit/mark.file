            </ul>

            <p class="text">The main difference between a website's homepage and a landing page is that a landing page  is specific and a homepage is multifaceted A homepage's content introduces,
                whereas a landing page provides information tailored to its desired aim.As we ve mentioned, a landing page only has one goal; 
                homepages on the other hand, have various goals. For that reason, a homepage typically contains a variety of links. Landing pages typically only provide one link to keep visitors focused on
                the primary CTA. Therefore, landing pages only provide visitors with two options: to convert or exit the page To give you a better sense of the difference between the two, we've provided an 
                example template of each below:
            </p>

            <p class="description">A landing page is created as a specific page on your site that allows you to collect information about your visitors in exchange for something free (usually) like an e-book or other resource. 
    
                The idea is to capture data for lead generation.
                
                Therefore, the landing page has data entry options such as the participant’s name, email address, and sometimes their job title. 
                
                It’s important to realize that lead generation plays an essential and necessary role in your marketing campaign(s).
                
                Leads can be generated through sharing the landing page through networks like social media, paid ads, and content marketing. 
                
                Your landing page is a crucial element in creating customers from website visitors.
